## Reverse dependencies

Checked the 3 downstream dependencies. There was a problem in one package (multicolor), but the maintainer has already submitted a new version and is up on CRAN. See the summary at <https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/blob/master/revdep/README.md>

---

This version adds some more ascii animal options, and fixes some issues.
This is a re-submission of this version fixing a README link.

Thanks!
