Contributing code to `cowsay`:

1. Fork this repo
2. Add an ascii art animal in the `animals` vector in `animals.r` - just follow the other examples, and try to execute the code as a character in your console until it looks right. Be careful not to use auto-indenting in your editor on this file as it will wreck the formatting of the animals.
3. If your animal contains non-ascii characters, it will not display properly in Windows. Please add it to the list of animals that don't work in Windows in the `@details` section in the help for the `say` function.
4. Push back up to your account, then send a pull request to `sckott/cowsay`.
